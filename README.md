and all default native ffmpeg codecs.

### Usage
```Dockerfile
COPY --from=mwader/static-ffmpeg:4.2.2 /ffmpeg /ffprobe /usr/local/bin/
```
```sh
docker run --rm -u $UID:$GROUPS -v "$PWD:$PWD" -w "$PWD" mwader/static-ffmpeg:4.2.2 -i file.wav file.mp3
```
```sh
docker run --rm --entrypoint=/ffprobe -u $UID:$GROUPS -v "$PWD:$PWD" -w "$PWD" mwader/static-ffmpeg:4.2.2 -i file.wav
```

### Files in the image
`/ffmpeg` ffmpeg binary  
`/ffprobe` ffprobe binary  
`/qt-faststart` qt-faststart binary  
`/doc` Documentation  
`/versions.json` JSON file with ffmpeg and library versions  
`/etc/ssl/cert.pem` CA certs to make `-tls_verify 1 -ca_file /etc/ssl/cert.pem` work if running image directly

### Security

Binaries are built with various hardening features but it's probably still a good idea to run
them as non-root even when used inside a container, especially so if running on input files
that you don't control.

### TLS

Binaries are built with TLS support but by default ffmpeg currently do
not do certificate verifications. To enable verification you need to run
ffmpeg with `-tls_verify 1` and `-ca_file /path/to/cert.pem`. For alpine
the ca file is included by default at `/etc/ssl/cert.pem` and for debian/ubuntu
you have to install the `ca-certificates` package which will install the file at
`/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt`.

### TODOs and possible things to add

* Add [vmaf](https://github.com/Netflix/vmaf) support
* Add [rav1e](https://github.com/xiph/rav1e) support when in stable
* Add acceleration support (GPU, CUDA, ...)
* Add qt-faststart
* Add *.a *.so libraries, headers and pkg-config somehow
